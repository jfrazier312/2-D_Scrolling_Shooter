Genre: 
	A shooting scroller similar to Galaga.
Name: 
	Galactic Ace
	You are the last line of defense and the last hope against the invading aliens.
	Humanity's only chance for survival is if you can manage to survive the wave of 
	enemies and reach the invader's mothership and destroy it. Ammunition is low,
	so you must destroy as many enemy ships as you can in order to salvage their
	components and use them to create more bullets.
	
	I've always enjoyed scrolling shooter games and have spent hours playing
	Galaga back when I used to go to arcades. The main differences between
	Galactic Ace and Galaga will be the ammunition limit, hit points instead of lives,
	and a boss level where the gameplay mechanics differ.
Goal: 
	Destroy as many enemy ships as possible with your bullets while avoiding enemy fire.
	There is a time limit until your ship reaches the mothership, so be sure to destroy
	as many enemy ships as possible on your way, or it may be more difficult to
	defeat the boss!
Basic Mechanics:
	Main:
	Spacebar: Shoot 
	Left/Right arrow keys: Move
	
	Boss:
	Use the arrow keys to repeat the pattern shown
	
	Cheat Codes:
	Press 'd' for infinite lives
	Press 'f' for infinite ammo
	Press 'b' to automatically input the correct missile launch sequence for boss
	
Modes:
	Main shooting mode: very similar to Galaga type games. 
	Boss battle: A memory style scene where you will be shown a missile launch sequence 
				and instructed to input the exact command into your ship to launch it 
				successfully.
