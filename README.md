A basic javaFX game. Design.txt located in Compsci308_Project1_Game/src/game.

TODO: 
TODO: Collision with enemy ship
TODO: Create missile launch animation for boss scene
TODO: Move all key inputs to new class?
TODO: Create static class in GameView to keep track of GameState (instead of using so many instance variables/fields)
TODO: General clean up of comments, prints
TODO: Implement Explosion.java

Issues: 
Too many instance variables
Gameview class is too large
More efficient method to track win/lost besides timeline boolean checker
